#publish_files.py: A python script to automatically
#scan, hash, upload and delete files in a internet server folder.
#Î¤his version of the script is allowing instant
#publication of files in a connected webpage through the HTTP POST.
#Php code exists in the server side to allow the publication.
#This is NOT a standalone script.
